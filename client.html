              <p>In many regions around the world, there are restrictions on natural resource use. Where it is possible to transfer resource rights, local rules are usually complicated, making transfers time-consuming and costly to organize. To tackle this, Mammoth Trading designs trading platforms that handle the complexity of local physical and regulatory systems in the background and allow people and businesses to exchange resources with ease and clarity. The trading systems maintain anonymity and confidentiality of customer information.
