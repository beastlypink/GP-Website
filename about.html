              Martin Merz is a master’s student at the Bren School pursuing a specialization in Water Resources Management. As part of the Sustainable Water Markets Fellowship Program, he is focusing on how markets can be harnessed to benefit water trusts  and state agencies in securing water for instream flows. As research assistant to professor Gary Libecap, he is working on a Strategic Environmental Research Initiative (SERI) project regarding dams in the United States, and on the Multicampus Research Programs and Initiatives (MRPI) research on the potential for environmental markets in California. He is part of the Bren Environmental Justice Club, the Student-Faculty Social Committee, and founded the Bren Spanish Conversation Club. Martin holds a BA in environmental studies and ecology and evolutionary biology, with a minor in Geography, from the University of Colorado, Boulder, where, as a research assistant, he studied the effects of trout introductions on high-elevation lakes.

              Adriel Leon is a master’s student specializing in water resources management at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management. He comes to the Bren School after working for three years in the healthcare industry. During his undergraduate, he worked as a research assistant on multiple projects covering topics from aquaculture development for Sea Urchins to lead (Pb) concentrations in soils in Baltimore’s rural and urban parks. His interest in environmental science took off when he worked as a research assistant to develop a native plant species palette for the Green Roofs in Los Angeles. At the Bren School, he plans to build upon his research background to analyze current water supply challenges in the Western United States. Adriel graduated from Loyola Marymount University in 2010 with a B.S. in Biology.
