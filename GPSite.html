      <h2>The Project</h2>
      <p>
        <h3>Brief</h3>
      <p>This project examines the factors that can help the expansion of environmental water markets as a solution to streams and rivers going dry.</p>
      <p>
        <h3>Abstract</h3>

        <p>
        Growing water demand in the western United States has led to the reduction and even loss of stream flows that provide vital ecological benefits for fish and other wildlife. Environmental water markets provide a means to redistribute water from existing uses to environmental flow smoothly and flexibly. Many factors have obstructed environmental water markets from expanding to a scale that can address widespread flow restoration needs. In order to understand these obstructions and identify how they might be overcome, this report analyzes the demand for and supply of environmental water, legal constraints, and current market approaches, revealing strategies that can expand environmental water markets. The report recommends that environmental water buyers do the following: (1) work with water right holders to measure current water uses and identify beneficial approaches for reallocations to streamflow; (2) expand into new areas strategically and conservatively; and (3) utilize diverse funding streams whenever possible to allow for maximum flexibility of approaches.
