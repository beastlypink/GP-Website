      <h2>The Project</h2>
      <p>
        <h3>Brief</h3>
      <p>This project examines the thoughts and concerns of water rights holders, water trusts, and other involved agencies during water transactions in order to evaluate the applicability of temporary market platforms for water trusts to lease water rights in drought years and the complexity of developing appropriate market platforms, as influenced by geophysical, biological, and institutional relationships.</p>
      <p>
        <h3>Executive Summary</h3>

        <p>
        Water markets have increased in prevalence and gained recognition in the mainstream water debate as a critical tool for addressing water shortages in the Western United States. New technologies have the potential to catalyze the expansion of water markets through bringing buyers and sellers together in an automated online trading platform, with information on marginal water availability and pricing leading to mutually beneficial transactions. Water trusts essentially represent the environmental sector in these markets, having been established in the western United States with the purpose of acquiring water rights for environmental reasons. Instead of purchasing water rights, water trusts often lease surface water from water right holders for the purpose of keeping it instream during ecologically critical months of the year.
        <p>
        An automated market platform for instream flow leases, operating primarily during drought years, could better connect water trusts with water rights holders. This will lead to transactions where the individuals temporarily leasing away their water will profit financially, and water trusts leasing the water will profit through approaching their instream flow targets and satisfying their donors. Lowing the searching and transaction costs associated with these environmental transfers is important because transaction costs of leasing water rights are often higher than the cost of the water itself due to the time and effort spent identifying and negotiating with rights-holders (Beatie, 2014). This means that some plausible instream flow transfers with the potential to be mutually beneficial are terminated, or are never initiated, because the searching and transaction costs render them no longer cost effective. The transaction costs are even more of an obstacle during drought years when many water trusts do not have the funding or the operational capacity to identify and execute enough transfers to meet adequate instream flow targets.
        <p>
        An online smart market platform will lower transaction costs and increase environmental water market activity. However, the application of a smart market platform will be more beneficial and feasible given specific basin characteristics and sociopolitical frameworks. Our project aims to identify which watershed and water trust characteristics, such as water trust size and funding source, and basin level market activity and water rights heterogeneity, influence the practicality of a market platform. An understanding of which characteristics will impact the feasibility of a market platform will involve customer discovery through interviews with water trusts, water-rights holders, and related agencies. The interviews will give insight into the needs and wants of potential market participants which, in turn, will aid in creating an efficient market platform that serves the needs of all parties involved. Once we have gained an understanding of the characteristics involved, we will strategically select focal basins yielding case studies for evaluating the feasibility of a drought-year water leasing platform given various water trust and basin characteristics. We will build and run hydro-economic market simulations within our case study basins, providing for a  general view of which characteristics add or detract from the success of an online smart markets platform. A business model will be synthesized from our findings, providing for a ‘go or no-go’ conclusion for given basin characteristics.
